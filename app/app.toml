# App Configuration
#
# This file maps action names to Lua script files.
# Actions are triggered by button clicks (and other UI events).
# Scripts can read from and write to the Store.
#
# IMPORTANT: Scripts live in the app directory, NOT in skin packs.
# Skins are purely aesthetic and reference action names only.
